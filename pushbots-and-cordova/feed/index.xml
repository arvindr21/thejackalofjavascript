		<description><![CDATA[Hi

My name is Musah and i have a pushbots account called - RISING AFRICA

I&#039;m trying to send push notification that will open directly to the post when clicked.

I tried the openURL custom field but that opens with a browser

Also i did articleid, article_id and post_id but all didn&#039;t work.

I have seen all your videos but i&#039;m still stuck.

How do i fix it

A notification that when clicked opens the article directly.

Thank you

Musah]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am using cordova: 5.1.1, ionic:1.0.1 &amp; pushbots:1.2.x.

My pushbots works fine in android, but ios it fails. I hvae done all the configuration and alert is displayed in ios device related to user permission for push notifications. But when i go and check in the pushbots dashboard, device is not registered. What could be the issue here?

I am trying to register the device with code.

if (PushbotsPlugin.isiOS()) {
                PushbotsPlugin.initializeiOS(&#039;XXXXX_MY_APP_ID_XXXXX&#039;);
}

When i check the logs from xcode
