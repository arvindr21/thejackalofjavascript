		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your support Lola. Glad I could be of help. 

Private browsing persistent is always a challenge. In one of the applications I have designed for the web, we detected if local storage was available on page load, if not we threw an alert that either use the website in a &quot;non-private&quot; browsing mode or loose the privilege of persistence. 

Ideally local storage should not be used as a database on the client side rather a lite weight storage till the application process stuff. 

In a mobile app you can always go for sqlite instead of local storage. A more reliable way of storing information. 

Thanks. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Arvind, great article!! You book &quot;learning ionic&quot; uses local storage in an example app which gives a good example using local storage in practice. The book is a amazing!! I&#039;ve been programming using ionic for more than a year now. I still read it from time to time.  I am pre-ordering the version 2. Regarding local storage,   I use local storage in my app as well to store user preferences and session storage to store access tokens(loaded from keychain at run phase). however, the biggest concern of using local Storage is if user uses private browsing. My app will fail. Any advice on persistent data in a more reliable way? Is using a local json a bad idea for example?
Another question is in practice how to prefex items stored in local storage? If user try to use different accounts on one device, the items might get overwritten, am I correct?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you might want to update your LZString example to use &quot;compressToUTF16&quot; instead of &quot;compress&quot;. The &quot;compress&quot; method produces strings that are not valid UTF16 and thus cannot be stored and retrieved from localStorage in IE and Firefox.]]></description>
